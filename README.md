# Static Timing Analysis (STA) Landing Page

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a practical exploration of manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, enhancing the usability of a static website. It serves two primary purposes: preparing you for dynamically adding data to the DOM and demonstrating how JavaScript can improve user interaction on a static site. While this project only scratches the surface of what's possible, it employs common events, methods, and logic essential for dynamic web development.

Throughout the project, emphasis is placed on refactoring and testing. Each added functionality undergoes rigorous testing and refactoring to ensure optimal code quality. Expect to invest significant time in both implementing and refining the logic behind each feature. As skills progress, this iterative process will become more intuitive. Debugging code should be removed from the final submission.

## Choice of Topic: Static Timing Analysis (STA)

The focus on STA for this project was driven by its relevance and complexity within digital circuit design. STA involves analyzing timing paths and constraints critical to ensuring proper functionality in digital circuits. By choosing STA as the subject matter, this project not only addresses theoretical concepts but also showcases practical applications through interactive elements and visual aids.

## Contents

1. **Overview of Timing Paths**
   - Definition of timing paths in digital circuits.
   - Components of timing paths: Startpoint, Endpoint, Input Ports (PI), Output Ports (PO), and Memories / Hard Macros.

2. **Types of Timing Analysis**
   - Detailed analysis of timing paths: Register to Register (reg2reg), Register to Output (reg2out), Input to Register (in2reg), Input to Output (in2out).
   - Visual aids and explanations for each type of timing path.

3. **Goals of Timing Analysis**
   - Objectives of timing analysis: Verifying delay constraints, utilizing gate-level netlists, identifying and resolving timing issues.

## JavaScript Functionality (Continued)

The JavaScript (`app.js`) manages the dynamic behavior of the landing page:

- **Dynamic Navigation Menu:** Automatically builds a navigation menu based on the page sections.
- **Active Section Highlighting:** Highlights the current section in the navigation menu as the user scrolls.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Allows smooth scrolling to section anchors when a navigation item is clicked.
- **Scroll-to-Top Button:** Provides a button to quickly scroll back to the top of the page.
- **Card Interaction:** Enables users to click on card titles to display detailed information and images related to specific timing analysis types.
